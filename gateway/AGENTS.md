# Gateway — Agent Instructions

## Public API / Webhook Ingress

All inbound HTTP endpoints — APIs, webhooks, OAuth callbacks, or any route that receives requests from the internet — **MUST** be routed through the **gateway** (`gateway/`). Never add ingresses, routes, or listeners directly to the daemon runtime (`assistant/`).

Concretely:

- Define new routes in the gateway and have the gateway forward requests to the assistant over the internal HTTP transport.
- The gateway's public URL is controlled by the **public ingress URL** setting. All externally-facing URLs you generate or advertise (callback URLs, webhook registration URLs, etc.) must be derived from this setting — never hardcode a hostname or port.
- The daemon should remain unreachable from the public internet. It only receives traffic from the gateway over the internal network.

Why: the gateway is the single point of ingress, handling TLS termination, auth, rate limiting, and routing. Exposing the daemon directly bypasses these protections and breaks the deployment model.

### Gateway-Only API Consumption

All assistant API requests from clients, CLI, skills, and user-facing tooling **MUST** target gateway URLs. Never construct URLs using the daemon runtime port (`7821`) or `RUNTIME_HTTP_PORT` for external API consumption.

**Exception boundary:** The gateway service itself may call the runtime internally. Tests may use direct runtime URLs for isolated unit/integration scenarios. Intentional local daemon-control paths are exempt:

- `clients/shared/Network/DaemonClient.swift`
- `clients/macos/vellum-assistant/Features/Settings/SettingsConnectTab.swift` (health probe)

**Migration rule:** If a needed endpoint is not available at the gateway, add a gateway route/proxy first, then consume it. Do not work around a missing gateway endpoint by hitting the runtime directly.

**Ban on hardcoded runtime hosts/ports:** Do not embed `localhost:7821`, `127.0.0.1:7821`, or runtime-port-derived URLs in docs, skills, or user-facing guidance. Always reference gateway URLs instead. A CI guard test (`gateway-only-guard.test.ts`) enforces this — any new direct runtime URL reference in production code or skills will fail CI.

**SKILL.md retrieval contract:** For config/status retrieval in bundled skills, use `bash` + canonical CLI surfaces. Start with `assistant config get` for generic config keys and secure credential surfaces (`credential_store`, `assistant keys`) for secrets. Do not use direct gateway `curl` for read-only retrieval paths. Do not use keychain lookup commands (`security find-generic-password`, `secret-tool`) in SKILL.md. `host_bash` is not allowed for Vellum CLI retrieval commands unless a documented exception is intentionally allowlisted.

**SKILL.md proxied outbound pattern:** For outbound third-party API calls from skills that require stored credentials, default to `bash` with `network_mode: "proxied"` and `credential_ids` instead of manual token/keychain plumbing. This keeps credentials out of chat and enforces credential policies consistently.

**SKILL.md gateway URL pattern:** For gateway control-plane writes/actions that are not exposed through a CLI read command, use `$INTERNAL_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` (injected by `bash` and `host_bash`). Do not hardcode `localhost`/ports in skill examples, and do not instruct users/agents to manually export the variable from Settings. For public ingress URLs (e.g. OAuth redirect URIs, webhook registration), use `assistant config get ingress.publicBaseUrl` or load the `public-ingress` skill — do not inject public URLs as environment variables.

### Channel Identity Vocabulary

Gateway inbound events use a channel-discriminated union model (`GatewayInboundEvent`) with explicit identity fields:

- **`conversationExternalId`**: Delivery/conversation address (e.g., Telegram chat ID, phone number). Used for conversation binding and message routing. **Not** used for trust classification.
- **`actorExternalId`**: Sender identity (e.g., Telegram user ID, WhatsApp phone number). Used for trust classification, guardian binding, and ACL enforcement. **Required** for all public channel ingress.
- **"conversation"** is canonical vocabulary for delivery addresses. "thread" is reserved for provider-specific fields (Slack `thread_ts`, email thread IDs).
- **"actor"** is canonical vocabulary for sender identity.

Trust/guardian decisions must be keyed on `actorExternalId` only — never fall back to `conversationExternalId` for actor identity.

Physical DB column names (`externalUserId`, `externalChatId`) are unchanged; the rename is at the API/type layer only.
