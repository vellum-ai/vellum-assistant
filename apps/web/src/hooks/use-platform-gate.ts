   * When `true`, the feature is platform-hosted only — gate it whenever
   * the **active assistant** is self-hosted, regardless of platform
   * session or feature-flag value. Use for UI surfaces that manage
   * Vellum-hosted infrastructure (plan/billing tier, devices, machine
   * sizing, release channels, sleep policy, system events) which have
   * no meaningful behavior on a self-hosted assistant.
   *
   * The decision is "is the active assistant self-hosted?" — not "is
   * the app running in local mode?" Two cases this matters for:
   *
   *   1. A **local-mode app** can be acting on a platform-hosted
   *      assistant (lockfile entry with `cloud === "vellum"`). The
   *      platform billing/plan UI for that assistant IS meaningful.
   *   2. A **platform-mode app** can be acting on a self-hosted
   *      assistant — when the platform API returns `is_local: true`,
   *      `resolveAssistantLifecycleState` projects `kind: "self_hosted"`
   *      and the user is effectively connected to a daemon. The
   *      platform billing/plan UI for that assistant is NOT meaningful.
   *
   * The reactive source is `useAssistantLifecycleStore.assistantState`,
   * which is written by the lifecycle service from server resolutions
   * and gateway-auth short-circuits and covers both cases above.
   *
   * Truth table:
   *
   * | Active assistant            | Platform session | Result       |
   * | --------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
   * | platform-hosted             | yes              | `"full"`     |
   * | platform-hosted             | no               | `"disabled"` |
   * | self-hosted                 | any              | `"gated"`    |
   * | none resolved (loading etc) | yes              | `"full"`     |
   * | none resolved               | no               | `"disabled"` |
   *
   * `platformFeaturesInLocalMode` and its hydration state do NOT apply
   * to this branch — that flag gates daemon-side platform-API
   * interception in local mode, which is orthogonal to whether the
   * active assistant is platform-hosted.
   *
   * Defaults to `false` — the standard `"full" / "disabled" / "gated"`
   * behavior gated on `platformFeaturesInLocalMode`, hydration, and
   * the platform session.

 * non-hosted"* states (`retired`, `error`, `awaiting_version_selection`,

 * a permanent spinner / permanent disabled button in already-decided
 * non-hosted states is not "still loading," it's "no hosted assistant."
 *
 * This helper isolates the *genuinely loading* state — `kind: "loading"`,
 * before any server resolution or short-circuit has landed. That's the
 * only state where the gate intentionally returns `"full"` despite
 * unknown hosting (to avoid chrome flicker on deep-links). Pair it with
 * the gate value to build `isResolving`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const platformGate = usePlatformGate({ platformHostedOnly: true });
 * const isResolving =
 *   platformGate === "full" && useActiveAssistantLifecycleIsLoading();
 * ```
 *
 * Already-resolved non-hosted lifecycle kinds (`retired`, `error`,
 * `awaiting_version_selection`) should fall through to whatever empty /
 * error UX the surface already has — the gate's `"gated"` branch is
 * reserved for *self-hosted* assistants, and these states aren't
 * self-hosted, they're absent / broken. Don't gate them as "still
 * loading."
 *
 * Returns `true` for `kind: "loading"` and transitional states
 * (`initializing`, `cleaning_up`) where we don't yet know the terminal
 * outcome. Returns `false` only for already-resolved non-hosted states
 * (`retired`, `error`, `awaiting_version_selection`).
