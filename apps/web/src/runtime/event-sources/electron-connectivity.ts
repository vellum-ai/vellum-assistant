/**
 * Two concerns in one source:

 * 1. Forward main→renderer connectivity state broadcasts into the bus
 *    so domain consumers subscribe to `connectivity.state` uniformly.
 *
 * 2. Forward browser online/offline bus events to main via
 *    `reportDeviceOnline` so the main-process state machine fuses
 *    device-level reachability with its own health probes. Subscribes
 *    to `app.online`/`app.offline` rather than re-adding window
 *    listeners — `publishWindowOnlineSource` already owns those.
 *
 * Off Electron both halves are no-ops.
