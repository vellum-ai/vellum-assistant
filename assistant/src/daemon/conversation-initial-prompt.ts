 * Resolve the system prompt to freeze onto a newly constructed conversation.

 * The conversation's prompt is built once here and reused for every turn (the
 * agent loop never re-resolves it), so the persona slot must resolve correctly
 * at construction.
 *
 * - An explicit `systemPromptOverride` (including an empty string) is used
 *   verbatim.
 * - A channel-routed conversation carrying a non-guardian requester
 *   `trustContext` (e.g. Slack / Telegram inbound) builds with it directly:
 *   the requester's persona (`users/<slug>.md`) resolves via a DB contact
 *   lookup that needs no guardian binding.
 * - A guardian-class `trustContext` (background and scheduled turns, memory
 *   consolidation, managed desktop) warms the guardian binding first: its
 *   persona resolution reads the sync guardian-delivery cache, which is cold
 *   in worker processes (schedule worker, memory worker) and after TTL expiry
 *   in the daemon.
 * - Otherwise (no construction-time identity: the local vellum app sets trust
 *   after creation) the guardian binding is warmed first so the persona slot
 *   resolves the guardian's `users/<slug>.md` instead of `users/default.md` on
 *   a cold cache.
