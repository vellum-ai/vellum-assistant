/**
 * Minimal pino-compatible logger surface handed to plugin hooks. The host
 * supplies a pino child logger bound to `{ plugin: <name> }`; this
 * interface intentionally captures only the two call shapes plugin code
 * needs (structured object + optional message), so the public surface
 * doesn't take a dependency on pino's full type machinery.
 *
 * Each method accepts a structured-fields object followed by an optional
 * message string. Plugin authors that need pino's wider API (`child()`,
 * `level`, etc.) can cast to their own narrower interface in plugin code
 * — but the canonical contract here covers the 99% case.

 * immediately before the messages are handed to the agent loop's tool/LLM
 * iteration.
 *
 * The hook may transform `latestMessages` either by mutating it in place
 * (`push` / `splice` / `length = 0`) or by returning a new context with
 * a fresh `latestMessages` array — see {@link PluginHookFn}'s polymorphic
 * return shape. The daemon threads the final `latestMessages` value into
 * `agentLoop.run()` as the run-messages argument.
 *
 * `originalMessages` is the user's original message list, frozen for the
 * hook. Plugins should treat it as a stable reference point if they need
 * to recover from earlier transformations or compare against the pristine
 * state.

 * Multiple plugins' hooks chain in registration order — each plugin's
 * hook sees the previous plugin's mutations (whether by reassignment or
 * in-place mutation).
