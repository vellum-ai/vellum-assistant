/**
 * Public plugin-API types.
 *
 * This module is the source-of-truth for types that plugin authors depend on.
 * The rest of the assistant imports from here via relative paths
 * (`../plugin-api/types.js`). At publish time, this file's contents are
 * bundled into the `@vellumai/plugin-api` npm package; at runtime in the
 * assistant binary, the same source is reachable to user plugins via a
 * boot-time shim that re-exports from the embedded bundle.
 *
 * Today this module is intentionally narrow — `PluginInitContext`,
 * `PluginShutdownContext`, and the `PluginLogger` shape they reference.
 * Additional public types migrate over in follow-up PRs as the surface
 * stabilizes.
 *
 * Internal-only types (pipeline shapes, middleware, manifest validation,
 * etc.) stay in `assistant/src/plugins/types.ts` until they're ready to
 * become public.

// ─── Logger ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Minimal pino-compatible logger surface handed to plugin hooks. The host
 * supplies a pino child logger bound to `{ plugin: <name> }`; this
 * interface intentionally captures only the two call shapes plugin code
 * needs (structured object + optional message), so the public surface
 * doesn't take a dependency on pino's full type machinery.
 *
 * Each method accepts a structured-fields object followed by an optional
 * message string. Plugin authors that need pino's wider API (`child()`,
 * `level`, etc.) can cast to their own narrower interface in plugin code
 * — but the canonical contract here covers the 99% case.

// ─── Shutdown context ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**

 * paths only need to know which assistant version they're shutting
 * down against (e.g. for version-conditional cleanup of state files
 * written by a previous boot).
 *
 * Additional fields may be added as concrete plugin needs surface; the
 * `assistantVersion` field mirrors the init context's so plugins that
 * stash a version stamp at init can compare against the same name on
 * tear-down without keeping their own copy.
