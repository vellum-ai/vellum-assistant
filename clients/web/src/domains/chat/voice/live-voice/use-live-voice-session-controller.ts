/**
 * `useLiveVoiceSessionController()` — persistent owner of the live-voice
 * session controller.
 *
 * Mounted once by `ChatLayout`, which stays mounted across every chat-side
 * child route (conversations, home, library, identity, documents, the
 * fullscreen app viewer, …). Because {@link useLiveVoice} tears the session
 * down when its owner unmounts, the hook must live at this layout scope — a
 * composer-owned controller would kill the mic/socket on exactly the
 * navigations the title-bar session pill exists for.
 *
 * Routes outside the chat layout (settings, logs, account) unmount this hook
 * and therefore end any active session. That is deliberate: no session
 * control surface (composer bar or title-bar pill) exists there, and a live
 * microphone must never outlive its last visible control.
 *
 * The hook renders nothing and exposes nothing. Surfaces interact with the
 * session exclusively through `useLiveVoiceStore`:
 *
 * - `starter` — registered here for the lifetime of the mount; the composer's
 *   entry-point mic calls it to start a session.
 * - `controls` (stop/release/interrupt) — registered per-session by
 *   {@link useLiveVoice} itself.
 * - `state`/`error`/transcripts/amplitude — observable session state.
